Comparing yourself to others is one of the root causes for feelings of unhappiness and depression. 
Some days I feel like I'm going to accomplish everything I've ever dreamed.  Today is not one of those days #nomotivation #rainyday #gloomy 
Haven't been on a holiday abroad in two years how depressing is that btw‚òπÔ∏è 
@user sad day Danny üòìyou have been and still are a true Leeds rhino you have been brilliant at the club I will miss you 
Said it once and I'll probably say it again, anything more depressing than making your sandwiches for work the next day #cry 
Why  o they call it a happy mea. if it tastes like a whole lot like depression. 
lonely is not being alone, it's the feeling that no one cares. #alone #depressed #anxiety
