Comparing yourself to others is one of the root causes for feelings of unhappiness and depression. 
For every one concept I try to cram into my brain, I feel like I'm pushing out three. #panic 
Don't grieve over things so badly.. 
@user Like you said, its all propaganda against #Israel. Palestinian adults and their Govt are full of #hatred. So sad to see 
So exhausted I could cry ðŸ˜­ 
Why  o they call it a happy mea. if it tastes like a whole lot like depression.
