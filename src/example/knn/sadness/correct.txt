My visit to hospital for care triggered #trauma from accident 20+yrs ago and image of my dead brother in it. Feeling symptoms of #depression 
Comparing yourself to others is one of the root causes for feelings of unhappiness and depression. 
And let the depression take the stage once more ðŸ™ƒ 
For every one concept I try to cram into my brain, I feel like I'm pushing out three. #panic 
@user I don't know my mouth was burning the whole time 
#depression is a condition which will affect an estimated one in five of the population at some point in their lives 
When you miss a call from @user #devastated ðŸ˜­ I'm trying not to #cry ðŸ˜­

Said it once and I'll probably say it again, anything more depressing than making your sandwiches for work the next day #cry
