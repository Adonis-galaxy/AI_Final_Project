John 14:27\nLet not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. #peace #afraid Ground truth: joy
Prepare to suffer the sting of Ghost Rider's power! Prepare to know the true meaning of hell! Ground truth: anger
On 1 side is the concern &amp; fear 4 our teens' safety &amp; happiness #thathorriblesuicidegame #terrifying #sosick (contd) Ground truth: sadness
